    "items": "8 passionfruit, halved\n1/3 cup (80ml) light agave syrup (see "
        "notes) or maple syrup\n1 cup (150g) plain flour, sifted\n2 eggs\n300ml milk"
        "\n50g butter, melted\n250g creme fraiche or sour cream\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n100g hazelnuts, roasted, crushed",
    "process": "1. To make the compote, place orange segments and juice in a "
        "saucepan. Scoop passionfruit pulp into a sieve set over the pan and press to extract juice. Discard seeds. Add 2 tablespoons agave syrup to the pan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Using a slotted spoon, transfer orange segments to a bowl. Bring liquid to the boil, then simmer over medium-high heat for 5 minutes or until reduced by half. Pour over the orange and set aside to cool.\n2. To make the crepes, combine flour and a pinch of salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre, add the eggs, then gradually add the milk, whisking until smooth – the consistency should be similar to very runny cream (add more milk if necessary). Alternatively, whiz in a food processor. Pour batter into a jug, cover and stand at room temperature for 20 minutes.\n3. Preheat oven to 150°C. Place a 16cm crepe pan over medium heat and brush with a little melted butter. Pour in enough batter to almost coat the bottom of the pan, then swirl pan to completely coat. Cook for 1 minute, then flip and cook for a further 30 seconds or until golden. Transfer to a plate and keep warm in the oven. Repeat with remaining butter and batter to make 12 crepes.\n4. Place creme fraiche, vanilla and remaining 2 tablespoons agave syrup in a bowl and stir to combine.\n5. Place a dollop of creme fraiche and 3 orange segments on one-quarter of each crepe. Fold crepe in half to cover filling, then in half again to form a parcel. Repeat with remaining crepes and filling. Divide crepes among plates and top with remaining creme fraiche and compote. Scatter with hazelnuts, then serve."
